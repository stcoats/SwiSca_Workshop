## SwiSca_Workshop

Some instructions, scripts, and examples for the workshop "Swearing on Twitter" at the [6th Swearing in Scandinavia symposium](https://swisca.wixsite.com/swisca6)

These instructions will guide you through the process of setting up a Twitter developer's account and collecting data from Twitter using Python and the [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy) and [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc) libraries.

The first thing to do is to download this repository by clicking on the green "Clone or download" button at the top right, then "Download ZIP". Extract the folder to a suitable place on your local machine.

Then, use the following two step-by-step documents:

[Workshop I](https://stcoats.github.io/SwiSca1.html) to set up Python and the necessary dependency libraries, register a Twitter account and get developer credentials.

[Workshop II](https://stcoats.github.io/SwiSca2.html) to collect data from the Streaming and REST APIs using simple scripts and to create a map of those tweets.

The scripts in the folder can handle the "extended_tweet" metadata introduced in November 2017, introduced to allow users to post up to 280 characers.

There is a lot of documentation at (https://developers.twitter.com) and at the GitHub pages for Tweepy and Twarc!

During the symposium the workshop will only have about 15 minutes, so if you want to follow along, get started by going through these documents and setting everything up! You can ask questions in the symposium.
